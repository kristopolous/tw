point system for encouragement of posts

## search
Maybe the search page should be an image focused presentation like https://instagram.com/freerangela/

So what do we need to extract?

  * The fact that there's more than one vendor perhaps
  * The location of the vendor
  * The operational aspect (maybe it won't show up if we don't know where it is)
    * The age of the posts - which is really the former hiding as this.

## vendor dash
The similar searches of the people in a location - maybe the demographics? 

shoe fetish lady really wanted that, but I think you can connect the dots if you can find out what the nature is of the event
that people are gathering for.

I think what's more important is to find out the similarity in searches, the high underserved times, and the location of them.

## vendor page
If someone is paying for the site, they should definitely be able to flesh out a traditional vendor page or simply drop one in from
another site on a direct link to minimize their work.  In fact, that's probably more important then getting them to build a profile - 
free range chicken guy says that any time not on instagram is wasting his time because that's where all the impact is.  

That should be accommodated first since most of these vendors already have a social presence in the classic static traditional sense.

So logo + picture + name + contact button + social media link

It's basically a rolodeck card
