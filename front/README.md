  proposal of minimum $$

point system for encouragement of posts

The system is of course not just two words ... there's

  public:
  [ author, photograph, tagged business (if relevent), time, location, two words ]

  private:
  the questionaire interview that is given to the user.

  Regardless, the results should probably be a twitter knockoff

  This should be content focused, but let's trust that twitter is too

  Also the title has a quantity that specifies the number of results ...
  eh sure why not

  [photo] [user]: two words
          location | time
          [ photo ]
          

## search
Maybe the search page should be an image focused presentation like https://instagram.com/freerangela/

So what do we need to extract?

  * The fact that there's more than one vendor perhaps
  * The location of the vendor
  * The operational aspect (maybe it won't show up if we don't know where it is)
    * The age of the posts - which is really the former hiding as this.

The search for most of the im services are very user based ... this needs
to be content based.  Some vendors don't rely on customer loyalty at all
And that can be done through the existing services - that's not what this service is providing.

There's a few models of course ... there's yelp, twitter, instgram, facebook, tumblr, pinterest, reddit, flickr.  Search + notifications
are a key aspect to this.

The underlying user question that needs to be asked here is why
did the person press that button and what is the ideal course of action
after interacting with the results.

For sites like facebook, it's finding a friend of course.

For here, it should be finding a commodity item in a close proximity
and then making sure that they can get it in time.

It's also important to note why pricing isn't terribly important here
since the assumption is that most of the items will be within a
commodity pricing model.

I think the idea is that the most reliably *achievable goals* should take priority.

The focus here is to imbue valuable accurate information to assist.

## vendor dash
The similar searches of the people in a location - maybe the demographics? 

shoe fetish lady really wanted that, but I think you can connect the dots if you can find out what the nature is of the event
that people are gathering for.

I think what's more important is to find out the similarity in searches, the high underserved times, and the location of them.

## vendor page
If someone is paying for the site, they should definitely be able to flesh out a traditional vendor page or simply drop one in from
another site on a direct link to minimize their work.  In fact, that's probably more important then getting them to build a profile - 
free range chicken guy says that any time not on instagram is wasting his time because that's where all the impact is.  

That should be accommodated first since most of these vendors already have a social presence in the classic static traditional sense.

So logo + picture + name + contact button + social media link

  [ L ] Some Business Name
  +---+
  |   | # follow   # social media
  |   | # contact  # locate
  +---+

It's basically a rolodeck card

## "my" profile
There should be a way for someone to see what they contributed, where they were,
the reviews they left, etc...

Maybe similar to instagram

## user page
The user page is a public version of the "my" page.

## Post to xxx

I heard that airbnb's success ran from a "post to cl" feature on their site --- which changed the game because now people could post through
airbnb and get both sites.

So for here, the idea is that there'd be a "command center" kind of post where you can share it out on twitter, instagram, facebook.  As far
as the vendors are concerned, it appears that instagram is #1 with the other two being a distant 2nd and 3rd.

It would be nice to be able to pass through down to the other mediums and post in a nice way ... if there's enough space for a feedback to 2words, then put it in, otherwise, omit it.  It has to be better in all ways.
