## discussion

The link should be between the last map point and arrival.

Maybe the right choice is to make the interface emanate from the app and not be a push system at all.

When this is done we know where the user is and don't have to ask any permissions about knowing what device searched what

## design

A hybrid between instagram, twitter, facebook, and search is the way to go:

Things to notice:

 * The activity bar with all the functionality.
 * There's an obvious content creation focal point - bottom center.
 * The twitter design could facilitate the search

## emotional goals

evoke: clean, safe, secure, accurate, urgent.  snapchat heavily evokes privacy.
