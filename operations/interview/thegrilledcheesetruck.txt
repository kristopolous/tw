How do you find new customers or locations to do business?

How important is return business and or customer loyalty?
 How much do you rely on your customers to do marketing for you?
 How do you communicate to your customers where you will be?
   If yes:
     Do you have a good handle on how many of your customers engage with you
     on this?

Do you tend to do business in the same places?
How important is it to know who your competitors are and what their offering is?
 If Yes:
  If there was a way you could confidently know the underserved markets and current demand, would this change how you conduct business?

Do you observe any strict hours of operations for your trucks?
 If you found there were substantial financial benefits to going outside of those hours would you be interested in taking action on that?

Would you expect there to be a fee associated with marketing information to
help you make such decisions?
 Do you believe you would value the information enough to pay for it?
