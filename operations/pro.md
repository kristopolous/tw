# Purpose

To communicate cost and value propositions among a variety of potential options.

Ideally a user interface should communicate:

   Plan X: Cost range: C0 - C1 at confidence C, Profit: P0 - P1 and confidence P

The core idea is to address the utility maximization problem for small businesses

Most of the concepts here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_maximization_problem  should be 
communicated effectively through this interface, customized to the user.

Such a value proposition, however, should be immediately apparent to anyone who runs a business - whether they are aware of the math background or not.

In real terms we'd like to be able to see:

  * current demand
  * patterns of demand
  * predictive earmarks of expected demand

Ideally the business owner should be able to find low or high risk options and potentially get knowledge of pricing information in a market they are approaching in order to guide how they will structure the price of their product for a particular market.


Questions like 

  * Where should you go?
  * What is your expected return?
  * How long should you stay to try to actualize the expected return?

There's additional questions like:

  * Where are your customers?
  * How do you communicate with them?
  * How can then provide recurring value for your business after the sale?

These complex goals can't be communicated in complex ways

Available metrics:

  * People who searched for X also searched for Y
  * This week/month/year, people have searched for X here in this volume
  * People have *found* X here but were not satisfied
  * People have *failed to* find X here at hours *A, B, and C*

See if you can pull in the twitter and facebook followers and then cross-reference the two and connect the users

Adwords

Provides an always-on system that is geo-fenced around the advertiser.  The advertiser can increase the words that are hit
or increase the distance.

Words should be leased for some period and then put up for some kind of auction at the end of the period, so that more valuable words increase in value without abruptly killing off previous customers.
