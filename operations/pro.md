# Purpose

To communicate cost and value propositions among a variety of potential options.

Ideally a user interface should communicate:

   Plan X: Cost range: C0 - C1 at confidence C, Profit: P0 - P1 and confidence P

The core idea is to address the utility maximization problem for small businesses

Most of the concepts here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_maximization_problem  should be 
communicated effectively through this interface, customized to the user.

Such a value proposition, however, should be immediately apparent to anyone who runs a business - whether they are aware of the math background or not.

In real terms we'd like to be able to see:

  * current demand
  * patterns of demand
  * predictive earmarks of expected demand

Ideally the business owner should be able to find low or high risk options and potentially get knowledge of pricing information in a market they are approaching in order to guide how they will structure the price of their product for a particular market.


Questions like 

  * Where should you go?
  * What is your expected return?
  * How long should you stay to try to actualize the expected return?

There's additional questions like:

  * Where are your customers?
  * How do you communicate with them?
  * How can then provide recurring value for your business after the sale?

These complex goals can't be communicated in complex ways
